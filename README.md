# Life-Expectancy
Analysis of life expectancies (developed countries vs under-developed countries)
This Project uses data from World Population Prospects from the United Nations and World Bank Open Data.
The first focus of this Project is to determine the descriptive statistics (Mean, Variance, Skewness, and Kurtosis) of various under developed countries and developed countries using a Monte Carlo simulation.
The other focus of this project is to determine if there is correlation between life expectancy and other national development meterics (Pysicians per capita, Literacy rates, and GDP per capita).
